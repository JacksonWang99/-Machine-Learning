  Movie Recommended system
   * Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm is currently the most successful recommendation 
    system algorithm, which is widely used in many well-known recommendation systems, such as 
    Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, etc. In practical situations. Based on various users ‘habit and 
    unpredictable rating conditions, a single model movie recommendation system tends not to meet 
    users’ diverse demands. Therefore, to tackle with the singularity of movie recommendation system, 
    this report implements three algorithms to satisfy different group of users.
    In view of the different characteristics of users, we propose two types of models, namely user
    based CF and item-based CF. Among them, the item-    based CF class contains two models, namely 
    Item-item CF recommendation based on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and User-item CF 
    recommendation based on Alternating Least Squares (ALS). This model is mainly oriented to make 
    recommendations when users have few comments in the database. In the user-based CF category, 
    user-user CF recommendation is mainly for users who give more rates in the database to make 
    recommendations for the user. When the user is a new user, we can use the cold start model for 
    recommendation
